### [Booking](Booking.py)
When you run this code, it will create a booking ticket for the band tour, and it will ask about some of your information and then it provides you a concert booking receipt. In this example, it will show ticket id, your (fan) name, id number and the city for the tour. In this code the `functions` are `defined` and the `input` method, `if` and `else` statement and `f-string` (formatted string) is also used in this code.

This includes the four tasks in to run this code. Task1 is for getting the information or input from the fan (who is booking the ticket). In Task2 asking the fan about the ticket-type. Task3 is about the ticket confirmation. And Task4 is gathering all the information from all tasks and printing all information related to the ticket booking. The tasks are:\
    [Task1_booking](Booking.py/task1_booking.py)\
    [Task2_addons](Booking.py/task2_addons.py)\
    [Task3_approval](Booking.py/task3_approval.py)\
    [Task4_booking](Booking.py/task4_display.py)


### [Class Cat](https://github.com/ghanghas006/Python-Research/tree/main/Class%20Cat)
In this class we use the OOP principles. It creates the different categories of cats and also the cat is happy or not. In this code we uses the `child class` and `parent class` (Cat is the parent class). In this code `constructor` method, `getter` and `setter` method is used. This code is about the different categories of cats.

This class Cat includes two tasks for running this code. Cat includes the information of the different cats and Main prints the different cats information. These tasks are:\
[Cat.py](https://github.com/ghanghas006/Python-Research/blob/main/Class%20Cat/Cat.py)\
[Main.py](https://github.com/ghanghas006/Python-Research/blob/main/Class%20Cat/Main.py)
  
  


### [Class Pet](https://github.com/ghanghas006/Python-Research/tree/main/Class%20Pet)
In this class we use the OOP principles. It creates the specific pets categories. In this code we uses the `child class` and `parent class` (Pet is the parent class). In this code `constructor` method, `getter` and `setter` method is used. This code is about the different categories of pets. When you run this code, it will display the different pets which are write in the code. It displays their species, name, age and their sound also.

This includes the two tasks for running this code. Pet includes the details like name, age sound and species. Pet Main `imports` cow, polar bear, chimpanzee and lion from the pet class and uses to call out (for printing) the pets details. These tasks are:\
    [Pet.py](https://github.com/ghanghas006/Python-Research/blob/main/Class%20Pet/Pet.py)\
    [Pet Main.py](https://github.com/ghanghas006/Python-Research/blob/main/Class%20Pet/Pet%20Main.py)

### [IT5016_Assessment2_PartA20250641](IT5016_Assessment2_PartA20250641)
This is my assessment work for part A. In this I write code for the requisition details, it includes the staff information, requisition details, requisition approval and the display the requisitions.

In the Task1 it uses the `defines the function` for staff information. It used the `input` method for asking the staff about their details like date, staff id, staff name and `f-string`(formatted string) is also used in this code.

In the Task2 it uses the `defines the function` for the requisition details. It used the `input` method for asking the staff about requisition items they want and their prices. It also uses `import` method for importing the staff information from Task1.

In the Task3 it uses the `defines the function` for the requisition approval status. It uses the `if` and `else` statements. It also uses `import` method for importing the staff information from Task1 and requisition total from Task2. If the total cost is less than $500 it will automatically approved otherwise pending.

In the Task4 it uses the `defines the function` for the displaying requisition details. It also uses `import` method for importing the staff information from Task1, requisition total from Task2 and requisition approval from the Task3. At last, it calls out the main function for printing all information.

This includes the four tasks for running the code. These tasks are:\
    [Task1_assesment.py](IT5016_Assessment2_PartA20250641/Task1_assesment.py)\
    [Task2_assesment.py](IT5016_Assessment2_PartA20250641/Task2_assesment.py)\
    [Task3_assesment.py](IT5016_Assessment2_PartA20250641/Task3_assesment.py)\
    [Task4_assesment.py](IT5016_Assessment2_PartA20250641/Task4_assesment.py)


### [IT5016_Assesment2_PartB_20250641](IT5016_Assesment2_PartB_20250641.py)
This is my assessment work for part B. This code is based on the part A of assessment. In this I write code for responding the requisition by the manager. The manager should respond the pending requisitions to approved or not approved. This code uses the many methods and the methods are `costructor` method, `input` method, `f-string` method, `count` method for keeping the right information of the requisition id and requests and `if` or `else` statements. At last in this code the main function is called out that's why it prints all the information.

### [Members.py](Members.py)
This is the work that we done during the lectures. This code is written for memberships registrations. It includes the registration for member by entering their details, their programme details, withdrawn the programme or not and displays the members details. This code uses the `constructor` method, `f-string`, `count` method for adjusting ang tracking the program, and `input` method is used.

### [Product.py](Product.py)
This is the work that we done during the lectures. This code is written for the product details like the product name, product prices and their quantity.
This code has used the `constructor` method, `getter` method and `setter` method.

### [LibrarySystem.py](librarySystem.py)
This is the work that we done during the lectures. This code is written for library. It includes the details of the books that are in the library. It provides the information about the book name, their authors, their title and their availability status.
It includes the class patron and the class library.
This code has contained the `Parent class` (class Book) and `child classes` (class Patron, class Library). This code also includes the `defining function`.
This code has also the `constructor` method, `input` method, `f-string` and `if` or `else` statements.
